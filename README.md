# r-containers

This is a selection of Docker container that provide r-environments for testing purposes.

### Releasing new versions
New registry entries are triggered by tagging the specific commit.
For the image to be built the tag needs to be a valid [semver](https://semver.org/), i.e. of the form `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` (e.g. `1.3.0`).
